| Operation    | Purpose                      | Notes                       |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| MAC          | Dot product, matrix multiply | Most critical, pipelined    |
| ADD/SUB      | Bias, residuals              | Often vectorized            |
| ReLU         | Activation                   | Comparator + mux            |
| SHIFT        | Quantization, scaling        | Right/left shifts           |
| COMPARE      | Pooling, ReLU, clipping      | `>`, `<`, `==`              |
| CLIP/SAT     | Bound values                 | For fixed-point safety      |
| SIGMOID/TANH | Activation                   | Approximate via LUT         |
| MAX/ARGMAX   | Classification               | Pooling, softmax, control   |
| BITWISE      | Control, binary ops          | For BNNs or masks           |
| POPCOUNT     | Binarized models             | Hardware-efficient counting |
